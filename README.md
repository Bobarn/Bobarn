# 👋 Hello, I'm Brandon~ 🎉
## Software Engineer Hardened by Healthcare 

### About Me:
I am a former hospital tech turned driven software engineer! I've learned a lot both before and during this transition all of which have only served to make me a stronger, more motivated, and more curious individual and developer. I'm a huge believer in maintaining clear communication as well as practicing constant self-reflection and self-asssessment, both of which I have found to be incredibly helpful while working collaboratively and maintaining relationships with others.  I'm looking to use these skills to find my place with a company that has strong values in community at its core and improve our products at every level of the stack!

### Get To Know Me~! 
- 🧗🏻 I am a frequent rock climber, it's been my attempt to get over my fear of heights. I only boulder right now but that's because when I started I would get lightheaded if I stood on a chair!
- 🐉 You will also catch me regularly playing table top games including DnD, City of Mist, FATE, and general board games! (Not a board game, but I also LOVE Digimon, so hit me up if you're a digi-destined!)
- 🌱 I am huge into ecology as a hobby, you can sometimes find me at the tide pools seeing what algae and critters I can snap a picture of!
- 🎧 Laufey's music is the CONSTANT background music to my life, easily my favorite artist right now!

### My Stock of Skills:
JavaScript | Python | SQL | Flask | Express | React | Redux | SQLAlchemy | Sequelize | Node.js | HTML | CSS | AWS
